## Hello World ðŸ‘‹, I'm Chris!

Iâ€™m a Computer Science student at Western University, using this space to share and document my journey in tech. Right now, Iâ€™m exploring the worlds of full-stack development, AI and machine learning, and cybersecurity.


## ðŸš€ Projects  

Iâ€™m currently building a [**PokÃ©mon Nuzlocke Tracker**](https://github.com/chris-tela/nuzlocke-tracker), a tool that helps users track their progress in Nuzlocke runs. It features clean datasets for all main PokÃ©mon games and will eventually support offline database saving for gameplay anywhere.

Some of my other favourite projects include:  
- [**Credit Card Fraud Detector**](https://github.com/chris-tela/creditcard-fraud) â€“ a machine learning model designed to identify fraudulent transactions.  
- [**NHL Wordle App**](https://github.com/chris-tela/nhlapi) â€“ a fun twist on Wordle that challenges players to guess NHL players instead of words.
