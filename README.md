## Hello World, I'm Chris!

I’m a Computer Science student at Western University, using this space to share and document my journey in tech. Right now, I’m exploring the worlds of full-stack development, AI/machine learning, and cybersecurity.


## 🚀 Projects  

I’m currently building a [**Pokémon Nuzlocke Tracker**](https://github.com/chris-tela/nuzlocke-tracker), a tool that helps users track their progress in Nuzlocke runs. It features `.sav` reading, offline data storing, & PokeAPI abstraction.

Some of my other favourite projects include:  
- [**CareLink**](https://github.com/kayroye/CareLink) - An offline-focused referral tracking system designed for rural healthcare industries. Finished in 2nd place in the Spark x Western Developer's Society 2026 Hackathon.
- [**Credit Card Fraud Detector**](https://github.com/chris-tela/creditcard-fraud) – a machine learning model designed to identify fraudulent transactions.  
- [**NHL Wordle App**](https://github.com/chris-tela/nhlapi) – a fun twist on Wordle that challenges players to guess NHL players instead of words.
- [**EcoSentinel**](https://github.com/kayroye/EcoSentinel) - An AI + IoT solution to help solve the billions of damages caused by wildfires yearly (Hackathon).
